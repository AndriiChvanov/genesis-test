A/B Testing in Google Optimize

Testing Goal: Increase conversion for purchasing a tariff plan.
A/B Testing Tool: Google Optimize.

Options:
0 Control Group (Option A): Standard button with the current color (e.g., blue).
* Test Group (Option B): Modified button with a new color (e.g., red).

Implementation Steps:
* Setting up Google Optimize:
    * Create a new A/B testing experiment.
    * Add Options A and B describing the changes within each option.
* Configuring Variants on the Web Page:
    * Add Google Optimize code to each page where testing will occur.
    * Modify the button color in the code for Option B.
* Defining the Goal:
    * Set the testing goal as "Get my plan" in Google Optimize.
* Implementing Changes:
    * Create two options of the button differing only in color.
* Random Allocation:
    * Google Optimize will automatically allocate visitors between the control and test groups.
* Setting Metrics:
    * Track button clicks: monitor the number of clicks on the purchase button. An increase in this metric may indicate heightened user activity.
* Setting Test Duration:
    * Specify the testing duration, at least 2 weeks, to obtain statistically significant results.
* Results Analysis:
    * After completing the test, use Google Optimize to analyze data and determine which button variant led to increased conversion.
* Decision-Making:
    * Based on the results, decide whether to implement changes into production.
* Documentation of Results:
    * Document results, including metrics used, statistical significance, and decisions made.
